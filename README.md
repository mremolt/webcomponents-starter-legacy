# webcomponents-starter

Proof of concept to use web components for web apps (including redux).
Coming from an angular+redux+webpack perspective I try to replace ng with pure webcomponents + lit-html. 

As this project currently contains no polyfills (it's a proof of concept after all), it is only tested to run in current Chrome. 


## Install & run

```bash
npm install
npm run watch
```
or production build
